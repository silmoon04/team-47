- discussed interactions with other teams (databases, interfaces and methods to interact with them), potential regular meetings after week 5
- reviewed agile methods (user stories) vs use case diagrams
- note that we must share the same architecture as our partner teams, mainly for databases 
- note not to allow full access to our database by other teams - instead restrict (read-only access) to only the required tables
