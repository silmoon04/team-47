### Meeting 1: First Consultant Meeting
Mon 2nd February, 14:30 - 15:10 | Fatimah, Silmoon, Alexandra, Chris, Shakeel | In-Person (Shakeel - Online)

- discussed interactions with other teams (databases, interfaces and methods to interact with them), potential regular meetings after week 5
- reviewed agile methods (user stories) vs use case diagrams
- note that we must share the same architecture as our partner teams, mainly for databases 
- note not to allow full access to our database by other teams - instead restrict (read-only access) to only the required tables
- first project diary submission on the 27th of February is a somewhat informal submission, it is not graded however advice can be offered

### Discussion in consultant meeting:
Replace with user stories
Apply ranking to user stories (light touch statements of what is required)
Rather than referring to use cases 
Replace use cases with user stories id with names and provide ranking which are more important to implement.

Accepting payments expectation is to use their connection to payment facilities.
What are the methods that need to be defined. 
Architecture must be the same for all teams.
### Diaries what to include:
-	Account of what you have done 
-	Time spent
-	Looked at twice first deliverable and the second to judge individual contribution. 
Teams interact with our data base by having access to tables. Unconstrained access (not ideal) or access only to few tables that are related. 
Implement data storage will just be a matter of switching from our proxy to the database provided. We can implement our own proxy that can read and implement data.
